INSTALLATION DE INFLUXDB

Windows 64bits : 
Go to https://dl.influxdata.com/influxdb/releases/influxdb-1.7.0_windows_amd64.zip
 and download the last version of influxDB (1.7.0) at the time I write this. 

Then unzip that file in your folder and remember the PATH of that folder. 

Open the console command line and go to the PATH of your unzipped file. 
You have to write : 
    >> cd PATH\influxdb-1.7.0_windows_amd64\influxdb-1.7.0-1
    >> influxd.exe 
Those lines permit to launch the local server which will be “localhost:8086”

Then open another cmd window and write : 
>> cd PATH\influxdb-1.7.0_windows_amd64\influxdb-1.7.0-1
>> influx.exe
This binary launch the command line interface of InfluxDB, from this window you will be able to write commands. 

Go manually to your PATH  and open influxdb.conf then look for “bind”.
Change the previous value which is “:8086” to the new value is “0.0.0.0:8086” (line 239)

Try it out with the following line which will create you an account : 
    >> CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'admin'

Here we go, InfluxDB is installed and ready. 

Windows 32bits : 
I am sorry but you’ll struggle more to install InfluxDB as InfluxDB is only supported on the 64bits version of Windows. So you’ll have to use a Docker to run it.
